          <h3>Biography</h3>
          <p>
            Ranchi boy to cricketing god, Dhoni's tale is etched in glory's
            code. Unorthodox flair, lightning reflexes, he rose like a comet,
            defying all complexes. Captain Cool, ice under fire, his sixes sent
            bowlers into pyre. World Cups conquered, nerves calmed with the
            "helicopter," a legend sculpted, a billion souls set a-glitter.
            Beyond the boundary, an idol took flight, proving dreams soar beyond
            mere might. Though retired, his legacy rings true, Captain Cool,
            forever in you.
