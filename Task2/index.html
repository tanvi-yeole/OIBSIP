          <h3>Biography</h3>
          <p>
            Ranchi boy to cricketing god, Dhoni's tale is etched in glory's
            code. Unorthodox flair, lightning reflexes, he rose like a comet,
            defying all complexes. Captain Cool, ice under fire, his sixes sent
            bowlers into pyre. World Cups conquered, nerves calmed with the
            "helicopter," a legend sculpted, a billion souls set a-glitter.
            Beyond the boundary, an idol took flight, proving dreams soar beyond
            mere might. Though retired, his legacy rings true, Captain Cool,
            forever in you.

            As Mahendra Singh Dhoni announces his retirement from international
            cricket, we pay tribute to the cricketing legend and a true
            inspiration to millions.
